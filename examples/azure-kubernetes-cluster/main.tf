* # azure-kubernetes-cluster
* 
* This will create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
* 
* ## How To Use
* 
* ### Default cluster
* 
* ```terraform
* module "aks" {
*   source                     = "git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/hiscox/gp-psg/terraform-modules//azure-kubernetes-cluster"
*   resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
*   environment                = var.environment
*   application                = var.application
*   ssh_pub_key                = var.ssh_pub_key
*   log_analytics_workspace_id = module.law.workspace_id
*   subnet_id                  = module.subnet.subnet_id
*   tags                       = local.tags
* }
* ```
* 
* ## Networking
* 
* We deploy clusters into Azure subnets in order to prevent a native cluster from overlapping the on-prem `10.x.x.x` range. We also use `kubenet` network policy instead of `azure`. This means that a cluster assigns IP addresses to pods and services from within its own virtual network, specifically the `192.168.0.0/16` range, while the underlying nodes are assigned IPs from the Azure subnet. Each node then requires a /24 netmask which is used for pod IP allocation from the `192.168.0.0/16` vnet. The default node quota in AKS is 100 so if you need to use all 100 you will require 25,000 available addresses. To handle this we assign the range `192.168.0.0/17` to the `pod_cidr` which makes 32,768 address avaiable. We then assign the other half of the vnet, `192.168.128.0/17` to the `service_cidr` so that kubernetes services can be allocated IPs. In reality giving the services a pool of 32,768 address is way too many but given that the 100 node quota is satisfied it keeps the netmasking simple to just split the entire vnet down the middle.
* 
* The `azure` policy uses the local subnet which the cluster is deployed into not only for node IP allocation but also for pod IP allocation, requiring a very large Azure subnet to handle cluster growth but also upgrades. This can very easily be exhuasted and it also exposes individual pods on the vnet requiring an extra layer of security to keep it locked down to an ingress controller. 
* 
* ## RBAC AAD Integration
* 
* Azure AD authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. From inside of the Kubernetes cluster Webhook Token Authentication is used to verify authentication tokens.
* 
* To configure this AKS auto-creates a pair of service principals known as the Server Application and Client Application. Previous to the August 2020 AKS release we had to create these ourselves and supply them to the code. The below is the historical README of what this involved.
* 
* Server Application
* 
* * This account is responsible for retrieving a users AAD group membership. It has access to read directory data and delegates permissions to sign-in and read user profiles and directory membership. It is considered best practice to use this account accross multiple clusters for easier management and auditing. It is currently set by a default in variables.tf through its ID, the friendly name is AKSServerApplication.
* 
* This app registration has been setup in advance and is called: AKSServerApplication
* 
* The process involed in creating it followed:
* 
* * New Azure AD application called: AKSServerApplication
*  * Config settings:
*    * Supported account types: 'Accounts in this organizational directory only'
*    * Web redirect URI type: 'https://aksserverapplication'
*  * Hit 'Register'
* * Select the manifest of the App Registration and edit the 'groupMembershipClaims' value to: 'all'
* * Select 'Certificates & Secrets' pane and generate a new key â€“ I need the secret value so I can encrypt it for the automation
* * Select 'API Permissions' pane and:
*  * Under Microsoft APIs select 'Microsoft Graph'
*    * Select 'Delegated Permissions' and check the 'Directory.Read.All' permission
*    * Select 'Delegated Permissions' and check the 'User.Read' permission
*    * Select 'Application Permissions' and check the 'Directory.Read.All' permission
*  * Select Add permissions and then 'Grant consent'
* * Under the 'Expose API' pane of the App Registration select 'Add a scope'
*  * Config:
*    * Scope name: AKSServerApplication
*    * Admin consent display name: AKSServerApplication
*    * Admin consent description: Server application for AKS RBAC integration
*    * Ensure 'State' => 'Enabled'
*  * Save it with 'Add scope'
*
* ### Updating the Server Application Secret
* 
* The Server Application makes use of a secret with an expiry time of one year. To update this secret across clusters you can either update it with the existing secret which effectively just extends the expiry time. To rotate it instead you can run the Az Cli:
* 
* ```bash
* az aks update-credentials \
*     --resource-group myResourceGroup \
*     --name myAKSCluster \
*     --reset-service-principal \
*     --service-principal $SP_ID \
*     --client-secret $SP_SECRET
* ```
*
* Client Application
*
* * The client uses the delegated permissions of the Server Application to post user tokens for verification to AAD. It is reccomended to use a different Client Application for each cluster and to not use the same ID as the Server Application. If a user wishes to login they first must retrieve a Kubernetes configuration with the Azure Cli which verifies if they have the correct Azure RBAC permissions. Once done if they run any kubectl command they are prompted to visit the Azure device logon page which in turn calls the Secure Token Service associated with our AAD Tenant and the Client through the Server App will verify if your user or a group you are a member of has access to the cluster. Tokens expire after 60 minutes.
* * These typically follow the naming convention `${enviroment}${businessUnit}AKSClientApplication` and are set in environment, note for Production + DR we append a shortented location indicator, ie. ProdPSGAKSClientApplicationNE.
*
* The general process flow follows:
* * New Azure AD Application called: ${enviroment}${businessUnit}AKSClientApplication
*   * Config settings:
*     * Supported account types: 'Accounts in this organizational directory only'
*     * Web redirect URI type: `https://${enviroment}${businessUnit}AKSClientApplication`
*   * Hit 'Register'
* * Select 'API Permissions' pane and add:
*   * Select 'My APIs' and choose the Server Application called: AKSServerApplication
*     * Select 'Delegated Permissions' and check box next to AKSServerApplication
*   * Select Add permissions and then 'Grant consent'
* * Select the 'Authentication' pane under the App Registration
*   * Under 'Default client type' select 'yes' to treat as public client
*
* These two accounts are required in advance of standing up an AKS cluster.

*
* ## Cluster Service Principal for Accessing Azure Resources
*
* A cluster needs to be able to dynamically provision storage, load balancers and access networks. Historically we used terraform to create this service principal with the following permissions, this is know baked into AKS itself:
* 
* ```bash
* "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",
* "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write",
* "Microsoft.Compute/disks/write",
* "Microsoft.Compute/disks/read",
* "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/write",
* "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/read",
* "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/read",
* "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/read",
* "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/write",
* "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/delete",
* "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action",
* "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read",
* "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",
* "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/read",
* "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/join/action",
* "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/read",
* "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write",
* ```
* 
* ## Log Analytics
* 
* Clusters make use of a Log Analytics workspace to receive container logs, service logs, kube events, pod/node inventories and insight metrics. Example queries can be found in the ADO wiki.
* 
* ## Availability Zones 
* 
* The cluster is deployed across three availability zones for increased resiliency.
* 
* ## Firewalling
* 
* When hosting applications that need some sort of ingress you must either have an in-cluster firewall (like modsecurity) or an external Barracuda/App Gateway etc.
* 
* ## Cluster Access
* 
* Each namspace is bootstrapped with `read` and `admin` roles corresponding to groups in AD. The groups have the naming convention `${var.environment}-${var.application}-${namespace}-aks-role-[read/admin]`. This is to provide emergency write access and pod read access to users.
* 
* The built in cluster-admin role is associated to AD using the group naming convention `${var.environment}-${var.application}-aks-cluster-admin`. This grants cluster-wide admin privileges.
* 
* NB: when creating a Kubernetes role binding which uses an AD group you cannot use the group name, you must use its object ID. You can build clusters without having the groups in place, the roles will just not work. Once you have the groups and associated IDs you can rerun terraform using IDs and it'll update the groups in place.
* 
* # Suggested Add-Ons when Deploying your own Cluster
* 
* ## Nginx-Ingress
* 
* Nginx is a webserver/loadbalancer which acts as the entry point to the cluster. It is deployed through a helm chart and configured to spool up an Azure loadbalancer with an internal IP address. It runs as a daemon which watches the api `/ingresses` endpoint across all namespaces and configures rules accordingly.
* 
* Helm deployments which require client connections should include an Ingress resource type which defines the FQDN of the application, a service to indicate where incoming traffic should be directed to, any resource paths and annotations to utilise services such as certs.
* 
* ## Kubernetes Key Vault Integration
* 
* Prior to Kubernetes 1.16 we we're usuing the [Key Vault FlexVolume](https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-keyvault-flexvol) module. All new clusters are now using version 1.16+ so in order to access Key Vault secrets from pods the suggested method is to use the [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://github.com/Azure/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure).
* 
* In principal it uses a custom resource (see the driver repo on how ot do this) to define the type of access (VMSS identity, pod identity etc.), the required Key Vault instance and the names of secrets.
* 
* The secrets can then be used in pod deployments through volume mounts using the CSI driver, e.g:
* 
* ```yaml
* volumes:
*     - name: secrets-store-inline
*       csi:
*         driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
*         readOnly: true
*         volumeAttributes:
*           secretProviderClass: "azure-kvname"
* ```
* 
* The secret name(s) specified in the custom resource are then exposed as an accessible mount, cat-ing something like `/mnt/secrets-store/secret1` will give you the value of `secret1`.
* 
* # AKS Security - Additional Considerations
* 
* Azure Kubernetes Service is compliant with Security Operations Center (SOC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Payment Card Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
* 
* The underlying hosts use AppArmor by default which restricts read, write, execute and system functions.
* 
* ## CIS Kubernetes Benchmark Version 1.4.0
* 
* The configuration of this cluster has been graded against the Center for Internet Security standards defined by these configuration profiles:
* 
* Level 1 - these items intend to:
* 
* * be practical and prudent;
* * provide a clear security benefit; and
* * not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means.
* 
* Level 2 - extends the 'Level 1' profile. Items in this profile exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:
* 
* * are intended for environments or use cases where security is paramount
* * acts as defense in depth measure
* * may negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology
* 
* As of 2019.06.18 our clusters meet: XXXX
* 
* The following table indicates the passes and failures for each criterion.

* |  |  | 2.1.13 Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Scored) | FALSE | RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. Note: This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself |
