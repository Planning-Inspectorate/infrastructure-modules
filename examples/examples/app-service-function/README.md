## How To Update this README.md

* terraform-docs has been used to automatically generate this readme based on comments, variables.tf and output.tf.
* Follow the setup instructions here: https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs
* Write your terraform-docs to a file like so: `terraform-docs md . | Out-File README.md`

## Diagrams

![image info](./diagrams/design.png)

Unfortunately a number of tools that can parse Terraform code/statefiles and generate architetcure diagrams are limited and most are in their infancy. The built in `terraform graph` is only really useful for looking at dependencies and is too verbose to be considered a diagram on an environment.

We can however turn this on its head and look at using deployed resources to produce a diagram as a stop gap. AzViz is a tool which takes one or more resource groups as input and it will parse their contents and produce a more architecture-like diagram. It will also work out the relation between different resources. Check out all its features [here](https://github.com/PrateekKumarSingh/AzViz). To use it to store a diagram post deployment:

```pwsh
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -Subscription 'xxxx-xxxx'
Export-AzViz -ResourceGroup my-resource-group-1, my-rg-2 -Theme light -OutputFormat png -OutputFilePath 'diagrams/design.png' -CategoryDepth 1 -LabelVerbosity 2
```
